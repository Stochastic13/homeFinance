If you are reading this file, you are already very high up in my ladder-of-love. Great. Complete the guide below to rise up a few more rungs. 

The reasons for writing this guide:
1. **OCD(?)** - Under the community tab in the insights tab on GitHub is how this repository lives up to the best community practices. Creating this file gets rid of the yellow flag and the incomplete progress bar. 
2. **Declare that I am really glad someone is wishing to contribute (or at least read this file)** :)
3. Describe the actual contributing guidelines.

### How to create a good pull requests/issues
Step 1. Close your eyes, think of open source, feel good about it.
Step 2. Think of this repository and wish good things.
Step 3. Open a pull request.
Step 4. Explain in detail the changes proposed and the rationale behind the changes, without any assumptions on the developer's ability to understand technical jargon

### Community and behavioral expectations
1. No focussing on artificial or metaphorical differences
2. <insert a famous feel good quote>
3. All errors need to be called out, and called out nicely and non-roastingly

Thank you for the interest in contributing. As promised, you have gained a few rungs! :)
